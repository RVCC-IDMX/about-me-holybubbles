            <h2>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2>
            <div>
                <p>“Come,” said the lawyer, “I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see there is something seriously
                    amiss. Try to tell me what it is.”</p>

                <p>“I think there’s been foul play,” said Poole, hoarsely.</p>

                <p>“Foul play!” cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather inclined to be irritated in
                    consequence. “What foul play! What does the man mean?”</p>

                <p>“I daren’t say, sir,” was the answer; “but will you come along with me and see for yourself?”</p>

                <p>Mr. Utterson’s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat; but he observed with wonder the
                    greatness of the relief that appeared upon the butler’s face, and perhaps with no less, that the
                    wine was still untasted when he set it down to follow.</p>

                <p>It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying on her back as though the
                    wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made
                    talking difficult, and flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets
                    unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had never seen that part of
                    London so deserted. He could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so
                    sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was borne in
                    upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square, when they got there, was full of wind
                    and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole, who had
                    kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of
                    the biting weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all
                    the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the moisture of
                    some strangling anguish; for his face was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.</p>
